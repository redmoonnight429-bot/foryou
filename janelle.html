      "I actually wanted to tell you after my exams… but I understand, you probably couldn’t wait that long.",
      "The reason I didn’t confess earlier is…\n1. Afraid of being rejected\n2. Afraid your studies might be affected\n3. I promised myself I’d confess after I’m taller than you 😅",
      "So now… I’m not asking you to decide yet, whether you want a relationship or not. I respect your choice.",
      "I just want to talk to you normally… so we can be more comfortable with each other.",
      "To be honest, I feel excited whenever I see you or chat with you…",
      "These days I feel more religious, because I’ve been saying your name in my prayers.",
      "I’m sure this is unexpected, right? I’m not hoping for anything… because I don’t even know your feelings yet.",
      "And last… thank you for being my motivation to keep me active and happy.",
      "Thank you, Janelle 💕 You can ask me anything if you want to."
